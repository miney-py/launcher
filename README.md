# Miney launcher

This launcher is to be bundled with the miney distribution and doesn't make sense standalone.

It hasn't any depencies besides python and tkinter.

## Development

Primary target for now is Windows. The easiest way to get a development environment for Windows 
is to copy a Minetest and a Python folder in the source root, to mimic the windows miney distribution..
